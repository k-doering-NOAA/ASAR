## Modeling Approach

### Current Approach

<!---
This is a potential automated subsection which will dynamically changed according to the assessment model used to perform the analysis. 

Please provide a short, general overview of platform including reference to the model's paper or online reference.
--->

### Configuration

<!---
- Time blocks
- Spatial structure and considerations
- Growth differnces/morphs
- Parameters to estimate and parameters to fix
- Bayesian priors (for which parameters, distributions assumed, and starting values and bounds)
- Catchability
- Selectivity
- Retention
- Likelihood (penalty, reweighting, ect.)
--->

### Sensitivity Analyses

<!---
Descriptions of which sensitivity analysis to be performed. (i.e. which parameters or data input streams changed in different setups of the model and why)
--->

### Management Benchmarks

<!---
Description decisions on management metrics/benchmarks.
--->

### Diagnostics

<!---
Description of which diagnostics will be used.
--->

### Projection Scenarios

<!---
Description of which projection scenarios will be run and how the projections will be set up.
